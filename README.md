# Python-File-Encryptor
The Python File Encryptor is a secure application for encrypting and decrypting files using cryptographic techniques. It helps protect sensitive information by transforming files into an unreadable format, making it accessible only with a secret key. This project is ideal for personal data security and learning cryptographic concepts.
